    <p> You have rented some movies for your kids:
        <ul>
            <li>The little mermaid (for 3 days),</li>
            <li>Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it),</li>
            <li>Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?
        <p>
        var lm = 3<br>
        var bb = 5<br>
        var h = 1<br>
        var cost = 3<br>
        total = cost * (lm + bb + h)<br>
        return total
        total = 27
        </p>
    </p>

        Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies:<br>
        Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you a different rate per hour.<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Google pays $400,</li>
        <li>Amazon $380,</li>
        <li>Facebook $350.</li>
        </ul>
        How much will you receive in payment for this week? You worked:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>10 hours for Facebook,</li>
            <li>6 hours for Google</li>
            <li>4 hours for Amazon.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        var FbHours = 10<br>
        var GHours = 6<br>
        var AHours = 4<br>
        var FbCost = FbHours * 350<br>
        var GCost = Ghours * 400<br>
        var ACost = AHours * 380<br>
        var total = FbCost + GCost + ACost<br>
        return total<br>
        total = 7420

        A student can be enrolled in a class only if:<br>
        The class is not full and the class schedule does not conflict with her current schedule.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        var classSchedule = true<br>
        var classFull = false<br>
        const studentCan = classSchedule && !classFull
